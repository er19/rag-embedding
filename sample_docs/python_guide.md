# Python Programming Guide

## Variables and Data Types

Python supports several built-in data types including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type explicitly.

## Functions

Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword. They can accept parameters and return values. Python also supports lambda functions for short anonymous functions.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Python is a multi-paradigm language that supports object-oriented programming. Classes are defined using the `class` keyword and can include methods, properties, and inheritance.

## Error Handling

Python uses try/except blocks for error handling. You can catch specific exceptions or use a general except clause. The finally block ensures cleanup code runs regardless of whether an exception occurred.
